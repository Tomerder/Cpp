add an example to the description. add some words about that the user can't instantiate an object explicitly
maybe dtor should be private, and not generated? Evald will probably talk about it
i think you should use reinterpret_cast instead of static_cast

//
dflt ctor ושיהיה נגיש לסינגלטון - מה שנדרש מ-T
